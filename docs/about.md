# About Underground Movie Makers

We're a group of filmmakers who believe that the best stories are told from six feet under. Founded in a basement (because even that was too mainstream for us), we've been crafting cinematic experiences that make people say, "Wait, what?" since 2015.

## Our Mission

To create films so deep and meaningful, you'll need a submarine and a philosophy degree to fully appreciate them.

## Our Process

1. **Ideation**: We brainstorm in actual storms. Lightning sparks creativity!
2. **Scripting**: Written exclusively on biodegradable paper using invisible ink.
3. **Filming**: All our scenes are shot in one take. If we mess up, we just pretend it's avant-garde.
4. **Editing**: We use software so obscure, even the developers don't know it exists.
5. **Distribution**: Our films are shared via carrier pigeon and interpretive dance.

## Join Us

If you can't find us, you're exactly the kind of person we're looking for! Send a message in a bottle or leave a note under the third rock from the left in any park. We'll find you.

Remember: In a world of blockbusters, be a sinkhole!
